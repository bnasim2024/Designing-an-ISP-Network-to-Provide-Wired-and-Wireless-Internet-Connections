Title:  Designing-an-ISP-Network-to-Provide-Wired-and-Wireless-Internet-Connections

Cisco Packet Tracer Version: 8.2.1.0118. 

We take the help of networks to facilitate our daily work and to communicate with each other. But
in many cases, especially towards the village, we face various problems to connect to the network.
Although various ISP companies are now working to connect the Internet to the wire, some problems
still exist in rural areas. If a person wants to get internet connection then he has to bear the cost of
service charge, cabler cost, home router purchase cost to get the connection in the initial stage apart
from paying for the internet package. Also, sometimes it is too expensive for them to bear the entire
cost of running a device. At present, SHADHIN WiFi is providing wireless internet services from
district to village to solve this problem. We want to work with this existing service. In addition to
wireless connection, we will also provide wire internet service. Our goal is to make the customer use
the internet at a low cost. If the user wants, he can buy and use the internet pack according to his
need from any access point in the range of his device. In this way, he does not have to provide any
services other than internet package services.

The project faces issues related to wireless network connectivity. Users may experience intermittent
or unreliable connections to the wireless access points, leading to disruptions in their internet services.
Identifying the root cause of these connectivity issues and implementing effective solutions is crucial
to ensure a seamless wireless experience for the users.
The current design may not adequately cater to future expansion and increasing user demands. As the
ISP network grows, it is important to ensure scalability and accommodate additional subscribers without compromising the networkâ€™s performance. Scaling up the network infrastructure while maintaining
optimal performance poses a significant challenge that needs to be addressed.
